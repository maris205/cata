# Decentralized data Cloud

CATA is in fact a decentralized cloud storage solution.instead of having all of NFT photos, videos, and documents, in privately owned data centers around the world, they allow to distribute data across geographically distributed nodes, connected through a peer-to-peer network, and sometimes, orchestrated by a consensus mechanism (usually proof of storage). This is very different than a traditional cloud model which silos data into regions that are prone to outages.

Instead of having all the data stored in data centers, it gets broken down into micro-pieces (sharding), encrypted, and spread on the spare memory of multiple computers running software (nodes) and connected to a peer-to-peer network of other nodes running a copy of the same software.

CATA Decentralized storage cloud store data on a distributed p2p network run by computers located across multiple locations. Nodes are responsible for storing and securing data and maintaining the p2p network alive, communicating and sharing information with other nodes.
